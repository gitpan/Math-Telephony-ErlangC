Math-Telephony-ErlangC version 0.3.3

This module contains various functions to deal with Erlang C calculations.

The Erlang C model allows dimensioning the number of servers in a
M/M/S/inf/inf model (Kendall notation):

- The input process is Markovian (Poisson in this case)
- The serving process is Markovian (ditto)
- There are S servers
- The wait line is infinite (pure wait, no loss, no renounce)
- The input population is infinite
